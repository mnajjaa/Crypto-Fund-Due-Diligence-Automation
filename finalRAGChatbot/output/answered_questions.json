    "answer": "Based on the provided context, HashKey Group raised $100 million in its Series A funding round. There is no mention of previous or subsequent funding rounds, so it's difficult to determine an average funding range.\n\nHowever, we can analyze this specific funding round to get some insight:\n\n* The funding round was a Series A, which typically indicates that the company has received seed funding previously.\n* The amount raised in this Series A round is $100 million, which may be considered a larger-than-average series A round for many startups.\n* Post-money valuation of this financing is over $1.3 billion, indicating significant growth and value creation.\n\nIn conclusion, while we don't have enough information to determine an average funding range for HashKey Group, the context suggests that this specific Series A round was likely on the higher side compared to typical series A rounds in the industry.",
